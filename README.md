dotfiles
========

This contains all my config files for various \*nix stuff (bash, vim, etc.)

.bash\_profile
-------------

Contains my bash configuration nonsense. Good stuff, I assure you. 

.vimrc, .vim/
-------------

Contains my vim config, themes, indents, and syntax hightlighting.

.inputrc
--------

Contains my input config (really only there for history autocomplete).
